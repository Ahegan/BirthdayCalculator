# Glitch
This project is a very simple website, only one HTML page. I have just started leanring Java Script so I wanted a project to try what I was learning.
### What is Glitch ?
This website is a *glitching text* generator in which I will add different features while progressing in JS
### Futur
I don't already how this project will grow, I might spend a hundred hours there as I might spend ten, the most important thing for me being just to have a support to experiment in JS. It isn't responsive unlike my [first website project](https://github.com/Ahegan/First-Website), accessibility  on different platforms doesn't matter for this project.
