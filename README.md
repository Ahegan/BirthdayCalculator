# BirthdayCalculator
This website calcul the day on which your birthday is over a given period of time. This obviously isn't much useful but the main purpose of this project was to have something to work on and experiment while learning JavaScript. Even though it is still in progress, you can have a look at the [JS-Chain](https://github.com/Ahegan/JS-chain) project which one will be way more intersting and complete in the future.
