# JS discovery
This project is subdivided in litle projects. I have just started leanring Java Script so I wanted a project to try what I was learning. You can read lower if you want to see the explanation of each project.
## Glitch
This project is a very simple website, only one HTML page by *glitch* and an index to select the one you want. The project is tagged as a CSS project I am using Scss from different people to make those *glitches* but the the most important part of what I do is in JS.
#### What is Glitch ?
This website is a *glitching text* generator in which I will add different features while progressing in JS
