# JS discovery
This project is subdivided in litle projects. I have just started leanring Java Script so I wanted a project to try what I was learning. You can read lower if you want to see the explanation of each project. The project is displayed as a css project because I use Scss from other people in the *glitch* project but the main part that i am making is in JS
